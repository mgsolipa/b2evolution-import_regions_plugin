## Import Regions Plugin

This is a maintenance tool plugin for b2evolution meant to let the site admins load their own regional info into the database.

In the current version this plugin is only a skeleton waiting to define the real business logic of the import routine.

TODO:

1. Define CSV file structure
2. Read and process uploaded files
3. Import regions, sub-regions and cities rows from the uploaded file avoiding duplicate records.
